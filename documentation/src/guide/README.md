# Introduction

Minerva is a database toolset for managing large, structured datasets using
standardized storage mechanisms optimized for different types of data. It
provides mechanisms for:

* Trend/time series data, or metrics
* Attribute data, including a history of changes
* Notification data

All the data in a Minerva database is linked to generic entities, where
entities can have data of any of the mentioned types linked to it at the same
time.
