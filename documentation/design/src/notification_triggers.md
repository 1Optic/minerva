# Minerva Notification Triggers

## Description Format

The description of a trigger is stored in the description field as Markdown.

The Markdown flavor is a combination of CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown as supported by [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/#specifications)

It can be assumed that mermaid support is available when rendering the Markdown.

## Thresholds

### Threshold History

The history of threshold settings can be very usefull for explaining and
trouble-shooting previously created notifications because we have a record of
what the thresholds were at the time of the notification creation.
