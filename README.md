# Minerva ETL Platform

This project provides the Minerva ETL platform components:

1. Database schema definition.
2. Command line administration tools.
3. Library for interacting with Minerva instances.
4. Web service for Minerva instance administration.

# Installation

To install the administration command using cargo:

```
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

After that, you should have the Minerva CLI command available:

```
$ minerva --version
minerva 9.18.0
```

# Start Test Database

To develop Minerva instances, or work on the code in this project, you will
need a running Minerva database. You can start a Minerva database initialized
with a test instance using the CLI:

```
minerva start --with-definition examples/tiny_instance_v1
```

# Run Tests

Running the unit- and integration tests is as simple as running unit tests,
because test containers are automatically started in the tests.

```
cargo test
```
